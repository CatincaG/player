# Audio Player
*Made with <3 for a school project*
---

The features of my player are :
* a play/pause button
* a previous/next button
* a replay button
* a mute button
* a volume bar

I made it as a homework for web development class. My player works as any playlist (yes, it is basic, but every exercice is good, right ? :)). The songs can be played in a loop or the next/previous button can be used to change them.

I was helped by a couple of classmates with the array for the songs and I visited many sites for the different features. I found my inspiration on Dribbble and Pinterest.
