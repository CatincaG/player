# Audio Player
*Homework due to 1st of December*
---

The features of this player are :
* a play/pause button
* a previous/next button
* a replay button
* a mute button
* a volume bar

The player works as any playlist. The songs can be played in a loop or the next/previous button can be used to change them.

I couldn't make the volume bar and the buttons for muted/unmuted as one so I made them separately and put the sliding bar at the end. It still needs to be adjusted to the page.

I was helped by a couple of classmates with the array for the songs. And I visited many sites in order to have the different features. I searched for inspiration on Dribbble and Pinterest.
